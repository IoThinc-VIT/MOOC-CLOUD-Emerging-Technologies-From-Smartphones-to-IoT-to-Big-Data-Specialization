# Emerging Technologies: From Smartphones to IoT to Big Data Specialization
## Internet of Things & Augmented Reality Emerging Technologies
### About the Course:
What is the Internet of Things? What is augmented reality? This course deals with the new emerging technologies of IoT (Internet of Things) and AR (Augmented Reality).

IoT is a new emerging technology domain which will be used to connect all objects through the Internet for remote sensing and control. IoT uses a combination of WSN (Wireless Sensor Network), M2M (Machine to Machine), robotics, wireless networking, Internet technologies, and Smart Devices.

AR is the most effective technology in providing real-time and real-world view information to users, where advancements in Smart Devices are expected to trigger various new AR services.

Currently, IoT and AR technologies already exist and available services can be found. However, there is so much more to come in IoT and AR technologies, which is why it is so important to understand what can be provided through these technologies and how these technologies work.

#### Week 1
##### IoT (Internet of Things)
The lectures cover the services and essential functions of IoT (Internet of Things), which will be used to connect all objects through the Internet for remote sensing and control. The lectures first focus on IoT Service Support and Economic Impact, and then explain IoT Applications and the IoT & M2M Ecosystem. In order to describe the IoT Architecture, details on the Application Layer, Management Service Layer, Gateway & Network Layer, and Sensor Layer are explained. Next, IoT Technologies and R&D (Research & Development) topics are presented. Finally, details on IoT supportive wireless networking technologies are explained.
