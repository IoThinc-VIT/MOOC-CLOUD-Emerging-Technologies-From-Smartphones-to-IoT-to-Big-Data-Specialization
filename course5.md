# Emerging Technologies: From Smartphones to IoT to Big Data Specialization
## Wireless Communication Emerging Technologies
### About the Course:
This course covers the services and specifications of the most popular wireless communication technologies used around the world. 

The most popular wireless communication technologies are mobile communication, WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network), and WPAN (Wireless Personal Area Network), which are all included in smartphones. Among WLAN types Wi-Fi is most popular, and among WPAN types Bluetooth is most popular. Therefore, the lectures in this course cover Wi-Fi and Bluetooth specifications.

In addition, the evolution of mobile communication technologies is explained starting from the 1st generation (1G) all the way to the most advanced 4th generation (4G) systems. In addition, further details on the state-of-the-art LTE (Long Term Evolution) and LTE-Advanced 4G mobile communication technologies are presented.

#### Week 1
##### Bluetooth
Bluetooth is the most popular WPAN (Wireless Personal Area Network) technology and is used in every smartphone that exists. Bluetooth applied on smartphones is also used with A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile), aptX, EDR (Enhanced Data Rate), and Bluetooth High Speed (HS), which are covered in the lectures. The lectures explain the Bluetooth evolution which starts from Bluetooth 1.0 and evolves into Bluetooth 2.0+EDR, Bluetooth 3.0+HS, and the current state-of-the-art Bluetooth 4.0 (and 4.0 extensions), which can achieve up to 25 Mbps and includes BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) technology.

#### Week 2
##### Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi is the most popular WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) technology and is used in every smartphone that exists. The lectures explain the Wi-Fi Infrastructure Mode based on BSS (Basic Service Set) and ESS (Extended Service Set), and the Wi-Fi Ad-Hoc Mode based on IBSS (Independent Basic Service Set). Then the details of the IEEE 802.11 Network and PHY Standards for 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ad specifications based on frequency, bandwidth, and data rate are presented.
