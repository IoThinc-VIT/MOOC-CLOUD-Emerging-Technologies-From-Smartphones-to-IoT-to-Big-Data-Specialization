#Emerging Technologies: From Smartphones to IoT to Big Data Specialization
##Big Data, Cloud Computing, & CDN Emerging Technologies
###About the Course:
You have most likely heard about Clouds and Big Data before, and already know how significantly important they are and will be in the future.

Cloud Computing enables us to easily use software as well as processing platforms and computing infrastructure (that are not equipped on our computers and smartphones) from any location through Internet services. Big Data provides us with new intelligence from massive data sets, which can help in situation/condition/status analysis and decision making. In addition, CDN is the best technology to provide information/contents to Internet users in the quickest and most efficient way. Therefore, the information/software/database/contents from Clouds and Big Data centers can be very effectively supported by CDNs. This is why these lectures are combined together in this course.

####Week 1 
#####Cloud Computing
These lectures focus on the major features and functionalities of Cloud Computing. The lectures start with first answering the question “What does Cloud Computing do?” and then provide Cloud Computing Application Examples, and then provide description on the Cloud Models IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), SaaS (Software as a Service), as well as VM (Virtual Machine). Next, the lecture covers Cloud Services based on examples of the Google Cloud, Amazon Cloud, and the iCloud.
