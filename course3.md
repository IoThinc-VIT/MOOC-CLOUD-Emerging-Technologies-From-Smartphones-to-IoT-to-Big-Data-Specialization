# Emerging Technologies: From Smartphones to IoT to Big Data Specialization
## Internet Emerging Technologies
### About the Course:
Every information service is connected through the Internet. If your work is any bit related to information, there is no excuse, you have to know what the Internet is and how it works! The relation of information and the Internet is equivalent to the blood and blood vessels of our body, which we have been using and will be using every day of our lives.

This course will enlighten your understanding of what the Internet is and how it works. IP (Internet Protocol) IPv4 and IPv6 keep the Internet alive by enabling remote computers to communicate through various inter-connected networks through “inter-networking” technology, which is where the name “Internet” came from. TCP and UDP are used by the end devices (e.g., computers, smartphones, servers, clouds) that are communicating to connect applications/services across the Internet. The details of IPv4, IPv6, TCP, UDP, and Internet operations are covered in this course.

#### Week 1 
##### Internet Operations
The lectures first cover Internet Operations based on an example of using IPv4, TCP, Ethernet, PPP, and Wi-Fi. The lectures then explain the TCP/IP 5 layer model, which includes the layer 5: Application layer, layer 4: Transport layer, layer 3: IP (Internet Protocol) layer, layer 2: Network Access layer, and layer 1: Physical layer.

#### Week 2
##### TCP & UDP
You have been using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) your entire life, and now it is time to know what it is and how it works. First, the lectures cover TCP, starting with the TCP Header, and covers the fields Source Port, Destination Port, Checksum, Data Offset, Push function, and Urgent Flag & Urgent Pointer. The TCP lectures also include details on TCP Network Operations, TCP Connection Establishment, Window Flow Control, and Congestion Control. Next, the details on UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are presented, which include UDP Header, Source Port, Destination Port, Length, and Checksum fields.
